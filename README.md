# Missile-Command

This project is a one dimensional adaption of the classic arcade game "Missile Command"

The original game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eC_6QzvLrE

A demo of this project: https://youtu.be/K2Q93NSWim4

The Rules:
- The game consists of a 3 x 8 array of LEDs and 3 buttons
- "Bombs" fall from the top of each column
- Pressing a button will send a "missile" shooting up one of the columns
- When a missile meets a bomb, both the missile and the bomb are removed from play
- The speed at which bombs are generated increases as the game goes on
- If a bomb to reaches the bottom of a column, the column is removed from play
- When all columns are removed from play, the game ends
- The object of the game is to play as long as possible

How it works:
